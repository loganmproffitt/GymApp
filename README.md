This app was inspired by the desire for a simple and flexible workout tracking app. While there are plenty of good tracking apps out there, I find that many overcomplicate the process, forcing the user to conform to their idea of a valid workout. In my own experience logging workouts in the Notes app, I often log more details for certain exercises than others, or use short hand that makes sense to me. GymApp aims to capture this flexibility, providing traditional logging while allowing for personalization.


This app was developed with Swift in XCode and uses Realm for data persistence.
