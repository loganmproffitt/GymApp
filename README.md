GymApp (working on a more original name!) was inspired by the desire for a simple and flexible workout tracking app. While there are plenty of good tracking apps out there, I find that many overcomplicate the process, forcing the user to conform to their idea of a valid workout. In my own experience logging workouts in the Notes app, I often log more details for certain exercises than others, or provide a brief synopsis in the form of a sentence. GymApp aims to capture this flexibility, providing traditional logging while allowing for personalized logging specific to the user.

In the future, I plan to implement a Templates feature, which would allow for users to create flexible workout outlines and send them to other users. Users could then send back a completed workout to show what they did. This feature was actually suggested by my parents, who expressed the desire for a simple way to receive and complete workouts.

I would also like to implement a progress tracking feature, which would allow you to track recurring exercises. The app would then summarize and visualize your progress, allowing you to identify trends that led to better progress. However, I plan to keep this feature relatively simple to preserve the philosophy of flexibility surrounding this app.

While less of a priority, I would also like to add a simple Macros section to this app to allow for similarly flexible tracking of diet. This section will likely come after the previous features are complete and polished.

I am developing the app in Swift with XCode and am currently focusing on iOS.
